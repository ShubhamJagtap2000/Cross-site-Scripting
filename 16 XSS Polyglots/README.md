# Polyglots

- An XSS polyglot is a string of text which can escape attributes, tags and ***bypass filters all in one***. 

- You could have used the **[below polyglot](https://github.com/ShubhamJagtap2000/Cross-site-Scripting/blob/main/16%20-%20XSS%20Polyglots/ployglot.js)** on all **[6 Levels](https://github.com/ShubhamJagtap2000/Cross-site-Scripting/tree/main/11%20-%20Perfecting%20Your%20Payload)** you've completed, and it would have executed the code successfully.
