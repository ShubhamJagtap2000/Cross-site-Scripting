# Other Exploits

- XSS is often overlooked but can have just as much impact as other big impact vulnerabilities. 

- More often than not, its about ***stringing several vulnerabilities together*** to produce a bigger/better exploit. 

- Below are some other interesting XSS related tools and websites.

- `BeEF` is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the ***web browser***.
