# Perfecting Your Payload

- The payload is the JavaScript code we want to execute either on another user's browser or as a proof of concept to demonstrate a vulnerability in a website.

- Your payload could have many intentions, from just bringing up a JavaScript alert box to prove we can execute JavaScript on the target website to extracting information from the webpage or user's session.

- How your JavaScript payload gets reflected in a target website's code will determine the payload you need to use. To Explain this, click the green `Start Machine` button on the right, and when the machine has loaded, open the below link in a new tab.

- The aim for each level will be to execute the `JavaScript alert` function with the string `THM`, for example:
```
<script>alert('THM');</script>
```
